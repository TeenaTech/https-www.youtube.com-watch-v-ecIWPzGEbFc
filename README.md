Allen M. Turing in 1945 talked about programmers been experienced, disciplined and professionals. With time, in the 1950's programmers were made up of scientists, mathematician and engineers. The first computer was ACE ie automated computing engine. The memory of the ACE was made of memory delay lines. This was followed by the CRT; cathode relay tube.  In 1945, Allen M. Turing wrote the first code in binary(base 32).  This was followed by Fortran in 1953, Lisp in 1958 which was the first functional programming. In 1966 the Simula 67 language was created, GOTO paper in 1968 started Structural programming,  C programming and Unix was created by two mathematicians also in 1968.  Structural, functional and object-oriented programming was created in the late 1950's and early  60's  Turing talked about needing a great number of mathematicians of ability, discipline to keep track of the work been done. If we relate it to today, he was talking about teams handling projects and proper documentation to keep track of work been done. The use of GitHub is a way of keeping track of work been done and documentation.
